# Architecture

A top-down map of the library. Pull this up when you need to figure out which package owns a particular behaviour, or when you want to trace a request from `Session.Do` down to a TLS ClientHello hitting the wire.

```

Three transports, one session layer, one fingerprint registry, one DNS layer. The session picks which transport handles a request based on what the host advertises (Alt-Svc for H3) and whatever was forced via options.

---

## Packages

### `httpcloak` (root)

The public Go API. `Client`, `Session`, every `WithX` option constructor, the multipart helpers. Deliberately thin: everything interesting lives in a subpackage. Most options just set fields on a `protocol.SessionConfig` that gets handed to `session.NewSession`.

Files: `httpcloak.go`, `local_proxy.go`.

### `session/`

The stateful session layer. Owns the cookie jar, the per-host transport map, and the lifecycle of `Refresh`, `Fork`, `Warmup`, and state persistence.

The notable pieces:

- One transport per host, lazily created. The first request to `example.com` builds the transport; every later request reuses it.
- `Refresh()` closes connections but keeps the cookie jar and the TLS resumption ticket cache, with an optional protocol switch on the way.
- `Fork(n)` returns `n` child sessions sharing the cookie jar and TLS cache but with their own connections. The mental model is multiple browser tabs.
- `Warmup(ctx, url)` simulates a real page load: fetches the HTML, parses it, then pulls CSS, JS, and image subresources with realistic per-resource priorities and timing.

### `transport/`

The three transports plus the unifying `Transport` wrapper. One transport per protocol family.

- **`HTTP1Transport`**: raw TCP, TLS via uTLS, HTTP/1.1 framing through the `sardanioss/http` fork. Kicks in when a host doesn't speak H2 or when H1 was forced.
- **`HTTP2Transport`**: uTLS for the ClientHello, then a custom `http2.ClientConn` from the `sardanioss/http` fork. The custom conn is what lets the library send Chrome's exact `SETTINGS` order, `PRIORITY` frames, `WINDOW_UPDATE` value, and HPACK indexing policy.
- **`HTTP3Transport`**: `quic-go` from `sardanioss/quic-go` (with the `PRIORITY_UPDATE` fix and Chrome-style initial packet shaping) plus `http3.Transport`.

The other things this package owns:

- **Speculative TLS for proxy CONNECT**: sends the CONNECT request and the TLS ClientHello in one TCP write, saving a round-trip. Off by default because some proxies choke on it. Toggled by `WithEnableSpeculativeTLS`.
- **Happy Eyeballs**: IPv4/IPv6 racing inside the H3 dial functions. The first address to complete the QUIC handshake wins; the loser gets closed.
- **`raceH3H2`**: protocol racing. When a host advertises H3 via Alt-Svc and no protocol has been forced, an H3 dial and an H2 dial fire in parallel. The first successful handshake wins.
- **TLS session ticket cache**: in-memory by default, pluggable via `WithSessionCache(backend, errCb)` for distributed setups (Redis and friends).
- **Connection pool**: per-transport with an idle timeout. H3 idle is set via `WithQuicIdleTimeout`.

### `fingerprint/`

The preset registry and the data structures behind it.

- `presets.go`: Go-defined presets (Chrome 133-146, Firefox 133, Safari 18, plus iOS and Android variants). Each preset is a `func() *Preset`.
- `embedded/*.json`: JSON-defined presets (Chrome 147 and 148 across every platform). Loaded at package init and registered alongside the Go presets.
- `custom_preset.go`: JSON parsing plus `BuildPreset`. Powers both the embedded JSONs and user-supplied presets through `LoadPresetFromFile` and `LoadPresetFromJSON`.
- `describe.go`: the inverse of `BuildPreset`. Emits canonical JSON from a `*Preset`. Round-trip stable.
- `client_hello_ids.go`: string-to-uTLS ClientHelloID resolution.
- `akamai.go`: Akamai H2 fingerprint string parser. The shorthand format `SETTINGS|WINDOW_UPDATE|PRIORITY|PSEUDO` is parsed here.
- `ja3.go`: JA3 string parser and TLS spec builder.
- `headers.go`: header order and value handling.
- `preset_pool.go`: round-robin or random rotation across multiple presets.
- `priority_table_test.go` (paired with the runtime piece in transport): RFC 9218 priority handling for `sec-fetch-dest` driven priorities.

### `proxy/`

Proxy implementations. Three protocols are supported:

- **HTTP CONNECT**: for `http://` and `https://` proxy URLs. Used by H1 and H2.
- **SOCKS5**: for `socks5://` URLs. Used by H1, H2, and, if the proxy supports UDP-associate, H3.
- **MASQUE**: UDP-tunnelled-over-HTTP/3 proxying for H3 through an HTTP-aware UDP proxy. Implements the CONNECT-UDP method.

Proxy chains work (proxy through a proxy). `WithSessionProxy` sets one URL for every protocol. `WithSessionTCPProxy` and `WithSessionUDPProxy` together split it, for example SOCKS5 on H1/H2 and MASQUE on H3.

### `dns/`

DNS resolution.

- A and AAAA lookup with caching.
- HTTPS RR lookup for pulling ECH config. Used by `WithECHFrom` and the default ECH-when-available path.
- Per-resolver overrides (system, DoH, custom).

### `protocol/`

The IPC layer for the daemon binary (`httpcloak-daemon`). Languages other than Go (Python, Node.js, .NET) talk to the daemon over stdin/stdout JSON. Not relevant for direct Go callers, but `protocol/types.go` defines `SessionConfig`, which the root package's `NewSession` builds internally.

### `client/`

A lower-level client surface that predates the unified root API. New code should stick with the root `httpcloak.Client` and `Session`. The `client/` package still ships its own `WithX` options for backwards compatibility (`client.WithPreset`, `client.WithECHConfig`, and certificate pinning via `PinCertificate`).

### Other directories

- `bindings/`: language SDKs (Python, Node.js, .NET) that wrap the daemon or link against the C library.
- `pool/`: connection pooling primitives.
- `streaming/`: streaming-body request helpers.
- `extensions/`: uTLS extension shims.

## Forked dependencies

httpcloak rides on four forks. Each one patches upstream to expose fingerprint-relevant knobs that the original libraries don't.

| Fork | Upstream | What we changed |
|---|---|---|
| `sardanioss/http` | `golang.org/x/net/http2` | Custom `http2.ClientConn` that lets us control `SETTINGS` order, `WINDOW_UPDATE`, `PRIORITY` frames, HPACK indexing policy, pseudo-header order, cookie splitting. |
| `sardanioss/utls` | `refraction-networking/utls` | Additional ClientHello presets for newer Chrome / iOS / Safari versions, QUIC ClientHello variants, PSK variants, key share count control. |
| `sardanioss/quic-go` | `quic-go/quic-go` | Chrome-style initial packet shaping, transport parameter order control, `PRIORITY_UPDATE` frame fix, GREASE frame emission. |
| `sardanioss/net` | `golang.org/x/net` | Various small fixes for the `http2` interaction. |

These are pinned in `go.mod`. For local development, point a `go.work` file at a local checkout of any fork.

---

## Request flow

A normal `Session.Get(ctx, "https://example.com/")` walks this path:

1. **Cookie injection**: `session/` looks up cookies for the URL and attaches them as a `Cookie:` header, unless `WithoutCookieJar` is set or the caller already passed their own.
2. **Header building**: the preset's header order, the preset's values, and request-level overrides merge into one ordered list. `User-Agent`, `sec-ch-ua`, `accept-language`, and so on come from the preset.
3. **Transport selection**: `session/` looks up the per-host transport. If none exists yet, it builds one based on what the host has advertised (H3 via Alt-Svc cache) or whatever protocol was forced.
4. **Connect / dial**: the transport opens a connection if needed. For H1 and H2, that's TCP and then TLS via uTLS with the preset's ClientHello. For H3, UDP and then a QUIC handshake with the preset's QUIC ClientHello plus transport parameters.
   - Happy Eyeballs races IPv4 and IPv6.
   - Protocol racing fires H3 and H2 in parallel when the host advertises both.
   - Through a proxy, CONNECT / SOCKS5 / MASQUE runs first, then the handshake.
5. **DNS / ECH**: handled by `dns/`. The ECH HTTPS RR is fetched unless ECH is disabled.
6. **Wire send**: the transport writes request frames (HTTP/2 `HEADERS` + `DATA`, or the HTTP/3 equivalent). Frame ordering, settings, and priorities all come from the preset.
7. **Response**: read, parsed, and the body delivered as an `io.ReadCloser`.
8. **Cookie storage**: `Set-Cookie` headers from the response go into the jar, unless `WithoutCookieJar` is set.
9. **Redirect**: if the response is 3xx and follow is on, the flow jumps back to step 1 with the new URL.

## Threading and concurrency

- `Session` is goroutine-safe for concurrent requests. Internal state (cookie jar, transport map, TLS cache) is mutex-protected.
- `Fork(n)` returns sessions sharing the cookie jar mutex with the parent. Concurrent requests across forks contend on the jar but ride independent connections.
- Transport `Close()` paths are wrapped in `closeWithTimeout` because QUIC `Close` can hang forever on a half-closed UDP socket. One of the timeout patterns we watch closely.
- Per-request context propagates down to the transport. Cancel the context and the in-flight read, handshake, or dial cancels with it.

## Where to look when something's wrong

Map of common symptoms to the package that owns the relevant code.

| Symptom | Look in |
|---|---|
| Wrong JA3 / cipher order | `fingerprint/presets.go` or `fingerprint/embedded/*.json` for the preset's TLS section. Cross-check uTLS ClientHello ID. |
| Wrong HTTP/2 SETTINGS / pseudo order | `fingerprint/presets.go` H2 settings + `chromeH2Config` / `firefoxH2Config` / `safariH2Config`. |
| Wrong header order | Preset's `HeaderOrder` field. Verify against `tls.peet.ws/api/all`. |
| H3 not used | Check the host's Alt-Svc, the preset's `SupportHTTP3`, and whether `WithDisableHTTP3` was called. |
| Proxy doesn't connect | `proxy/`. Check the proxy URL scheme matches what the proxy speaks. |
| Hangs on close | `transport/` close paths. Check the QUIC close timeout wrapping. |
| Timeout not respected | `session/` and `transport/`. Context propagation, deadline computation. |

For everything else, the source reads easier than this map. Start at `httpcloak.NewSession` and follow the calls.
