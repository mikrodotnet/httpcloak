# Fork (Sibling Sessions)

`Fork(n)` hands you N sibling sessions that share cookies and TLS state with the parent but get their own connection pools. Use it when you want a pack of workers hitting a site in parallel under one logged-in identity, without all of them fighting over the same sockets.

Picture it as N browser tabs from the same browser window. Same login. Same cookie jar. Same fingerprint. But each tab opens its own TCP and QUIC connections, so they're not blocking each other.

## What's shared

Forked siblings share the live state that defines who you are:

- **Cookie jar.** Same pointer. A `Set-Cookie` from any sibling lands in the jar that all siblings (and the parent) read from. Login on the parent, fork, every child is logged in.
- **TLS resumption tickets.** The H1, H2 and H3 session caches are shared. First handshake on a fresh fork resumes from a ticket the parent already cached, so it goes 0-RTT.
- **ECH config cache.** Same encrypted-ClientHello blobs, no re-discovery needed.
- **Custom fingerprint state.** Custom JA3, custom H2 settings, custom pseudo-header order, custom TCP fingerprint, header order. The whole fingerprint surface copies over on fork.
- **Cache validators.** ETag and Last-Modified entries snapshot at fork time so siblings start with believable conditional-request headers.

## What's NOT shared

Each fork gets its own:

- **Connection pool.** Brand new transport. New TCP sockets, new QUIC connections. Siblings don't queue behind each other.
- **In-flight requests.** A request on one fork can't block or cancel a request on another.
- **Idle timer and stats.** `LastUsed`, `RequestCount`, idle close timers are per-fork.
- **Key log writer.** Forks don't get the parent's TLS keylog, so they can't double-close it. Set up your own if you need one per fork.

## Common pattern: warm up, log in, fork, scrape

The typical flow is: hit the home page on the parent so cookies and tickets land, log in, fork into N workers, hand each worker a slice of URLs.

What you'll see: every fork ships requests with the same logged-in cookies, every fork resumes TLS from the parent's tickets, and they all carry an identical JA4 because the fingerprint state copied over. Verified locally with three forks against `tls.peet.ws`, all three returned `t13d1517h2_8daaf6152771_b6f405a00624`.

## Lifecycle

Forks are independent siblings, not children with a leash to the parent.

- Closing the parent doesn't close the forks. They keep working.
- Closing a fork doesn't affect siblings. The shared cookie jar stays alive as long as anyone holds a reference.
- A `Set-Cookie` on any sibling propagates to every other sibling and the parent, instantly. Same pointer.
- Fingerprint state copies once at fork time. If you mutate the parent's header order after forking, the existing forks won't see the change. New forks made after the mutation will.

If you want a fork to have its own cookie jar, you don't fork. Build a fresh `NewSession` instead.

## Fork vs LoadSession

Both clone session state, but they solve different problems:

| | `Fork(n)` | `Save` / `LoadSession` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Where it works | One process | Across processes, machines, restarts |
| Cookie jar | Shared live pointer | Snapshot at save time |
| TLS tickets | Shared live cache | Snapshot, serialised to disk |
| ECH config | Shared live cache | Snapshot, base64 in JSON |
| Connection pools | Independent per fork | New session, fresh pool |
| Use when | Parallel workers in one binary | Persisting login across restarts |

Fork is for live fan-out. LoadSession is for resuming yesterday's session. They don't compete, and you'll often use both: load a saved session at startup, fork it for parallel work, save the parent again at shutdown.

:::tip
Pick a fork count your network can actually feed. 10-50 is the typical sweet spot. Going past that and you're just building a queue: every fork is racing for the same NIC, same DNS resolver, same upstream socket budget. You'll burn CPU rebuilding TLS handshakes you can't ship fast enough. If the target's running per-IP rate limits, more forks won't help anyway, you'll need real proxies behind each fork.

## Test it yourself

The test below confirms forks share TLS state. Three forks hit `tls.peet.ws/api/all` in parallel, and you should see all three return 200 with the same JA4 hash. If the JA4 differs across forks, fingerprint state didn't copy and that's a bug.

```go
package main

import (
    "context"
    "encoding/json"
    "fmt"
    "io"
    "sync"

    "github.com/sardanioss/httpcloak"
)

func main() {
    s := httpcloak.NewSession("chrome-latest")
    defer s.Close()
    ctx := context.Background()

    // Warm up the parent so it has TLS tickets to share.
    if _, err := s.Get(ctx, "https://tls.peet.ws/api/all"); err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }

    forks := s.Fork(3)
    results := make([]string, 3)

    var wg sync.WaitGroup
    for i, f := range forks {
        wg.Add(1)
        go func(idx int, fs *httpcloak.Session) {
            defer wg.Done()
            defer fs.Close()
            r, err := fs.Get(ctx, "https://tls.peet.ws/api/all")
            if err != nil { return }
            defer r.Close()
            body, _ := io.ReadAll(r.Body)
            var parsed struct {
                TLS struct{ JA4 string `json:"ja4"` } `json:"tls"`
            }
            _ = json.Unmarshal(body, &parsed)
            results[idx] = fmt.Sprintf("status=%d ja4=%s", r.StatusCode, parsed.TLS.JA4)
        }(i, f)
    }
    wg.Wait()

    for i, r := range results {
        fmt.Printf("fork[%d] %s\n", i, r)
    }
}
```

Sample output (Chrome latest, captured 2026-05):

```text
fork[0] status=200 ja4=t13d1517h2_8daaf6152771_b6f405a00624
fork[1] status=200 ja4=t13d1517h2_8daaf6152771_b6f405a00624
fork[2] status=200 ja4=t13d1517h2_8daaf6152771_b6f405a00624
```

Same JA4 across all three. That's proof the TLS fingerprint state actually shares, not just the cookie jar.
