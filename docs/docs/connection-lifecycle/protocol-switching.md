# Protocol Switching

Sessions can hop between HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, and HTTP/3 mid-flight.
`RefreshWithProtocol("h1" | "h2" | "h3" | "auto")` drops every live
connection then re-handshakes on whatever protocol you ask for. The setting
sticks, so future plain `Refresh()` calls also use the new protocol until you
switch again.

For sessions that should never auto-negotiate in the first place, pass
`WithSwitchProtocol("h2")` (or h1 / h3) to `NewSession`. Calling `Refresh()`
on such a session moves to the configured protocol every time.

## Why you'd want this

**Force H2 because the target's H3 is broken.** Some CDNs serve garbage on
their HTTP/3 endpoint while H2 works fine. The auto-negotiator picks H3
when available, so you'd never know unless you forced H2.

**Force H3 because the target's H2 blocks you.** Common with Cloudflare:
the H2 path runs through more middleware where bot detection lives, while
H3 often has lighter filtering, especially on plans where the operator
hasn't enabled Bot Management for HTTP/3.

**Test which protocol gets through.** Anti-bot tooling sometimes treats
H1, H2 and H3 differently. Lock to one and rerun the same scrape to
isolate the variable.

Bonus pattern: warm tickets on H3, then switch to H2 for the workload. The
kept ticket means H2 starts from a resumed handshake.

:::info
The auto-negotiation logic (`raceH3H2` internally) races H3 and H2 in
parallel and picks whichever wins. That's great for latency but unpredictable
across runs. Lock to one protocol if you need predictable behaviour, or if
you're debugging a site-specific issue and need to know exactly which path
the next request will take.

## Lock at construction time

To skip auto-negotiation entirely, set the protocol when building the
session. `Refresh()` then always lands on that protocol.

```go
s := httpcloak.NewSession("chrome-latest", httpcloak.WithSwitchProtocol("h2"))
```

Python: `Session(preset=..., switch_protocol="h2")`. Node.js:
`new Session({ preset, switchProtocol: "h2" })`. .NET:
`new Session(preset, switchProtocol: "h2")`.

There are also `WithForceHTTP1`, `WithForceHTTP2`, `WithForceHTTP3` and
`WithDisableHTTP3` options that pin the protocol from request one (no
`Refresh()` needed). Use those for a session that never speaks anything
but the chosen protocol.

## H3 caveats

Three things to know before you `RefreshWithProtocol("h3")`:

- The preset has to support H3. If it doesn't, you get
  `preset %q does not support HTTP/3` and the switch is refused.
- The host has to actually serve H3. Forcing H3 against a host that doesn't
  advertise it just times out; there's no automatic fallback when forced.
- H3 over a UDP-blocking proxy is a non-starter. Most corporate networks and
  many SOCKS5 proxies don't pass UDP. Use `WithForceHTTP2` instead.

If you want H3 some times and H2 other times, keep two sessions rather than
toggling. Every switch throws away the active connection.

## Protocol values

`RefreshWithProtocol` accepts: `"h1"`/`"http1"`/`"1"` for HTTP/1.1,
`"h2"`/`"http2"`/`"2"` for HTTP/2, `"h3"`/`"http3"`/`"3"` for HTTP/3, and
`"auto"` (or empty string) to race H3 vs H2 with fallback to H1. Anything
else returns an error.
