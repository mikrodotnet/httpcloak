# SOCKS5

SOCKS5 is the residential-proxy workhorse. The client connects to the
SOCKS5 server, does a short version + auth handshake, asks the server
to CONNECT to the target host, and from then on the socket is a TCP
tunnel. httpcloak runs its real TLS handshake through that tunnel.

It's basically the SOCKS5 equivalent of HTTP CONNECT, but with a binary
handshake and an auth scheme that supports username/password as a
proper sub-protocol.

:::info
SOCKS5 is the residential workhorse. Most providers (BrightData,
Smartproxy, Oxylabs, SOAX, IPRoyal etc) ship SOCKS5 endpoints by
default. If you bought "rotating residential proxies" from someone in
the last few years, what they handed you was almost certainly SOCKS5.

## URL shapes

```
socks5://proxy.example.com:1080
socks5://user:pass@proxy.example.com:1080
socks5h://proxy.example.com:1080
```

`socks5` and `socks5h` are both accepted. httpcloak always sends
hostname targets to the proxy as a SOCKS5 domain ATYP (address type 3),
which means DNS resolution of the *target* happens at the proxy. The
*proxy's own hostname* is always resolved client-side, that part you
can't avoid.

If your proxy URL passes an IP literal as the target host (rare, you'd
have to construct that yourself), httpcloak sends an IPv4 or IPv6 ATYP
instead.

## Auth schemes

httpcloak negotiates the auth method based on what's in the URL.

- No `user:pass` in the URL: client offers `0x00` (NO AUTHENTICATION
  REQUIRED) only. If the proxy demands auth it'll fail the handshake.
- `user:pass` in the URL: client offers both no-auth and `0x02`
  (USERNAME/PASSWORD, RFC 1929). Server picks one. If it picks
  username/password, httpcloak runs the sub-negotiation.

That means an authenticated URL works fine against an open proxy too,
the server just picks no-auth and the credentials go unused. URL-encode
special characters in the password the same way as HTTP CONNECT:

```
socks5://user:p%40ss%21@proxy.example.com:1080
```

GSSAPI (auth method `0x01`) isn't supported. If your provider requires
it, raise an issue.

## SOCKS5 vs SOCKS5h

`socks5h://` is a curl-ism that means "delegate DNS to the proxy".
httpcloak treats both schemes identically because it always sends
hostname targets as a SOCKS5 domain ATYP, which is exactly the
"DNS-at-proxy" behavior. The scheme suffix is accepted but doesn't
change anything you'd notice on the wire.

If you want to force client-side DNS for the target, you'd have to
resolve the hostname yourself before constructing the URL. That's
usually not what you want with residential providers, since the proxy's
DNS view is part of why you're using it.

## H3 through SOCKS5

A vanilla `WithSessionTCPProxy("socks5://...")` only routes TCP. H3
(QUIC over UDP) will dial directly to the target. If you want H3 to
also go through the SOCKS5 server, the server needs to support UDP
ASSOCIATE and you have to wire a UDP proxy too. See [SOCKS5
UDP](./socks5-udp).

## Common errors

- `SOCKS5 handshake failed: failed to read auth response`: usually the
  proxy closed the socket. Check the URL host/port and credentials.
- `proxy rejected all authentication methods`: server didn't accept
  no-auth or user/pass. You probably need to add credentials.
- `authentication failed: invalid credentials`: self-explanatory,
  typo or bad creds.
- `CONNECT failed: connection refused (reply=5)`: target host or port
  refused the connection. Try a different target.
- `CONNECT failed: host unreachable (reply=4)`: target DNS resolved at
  the proxy to something unroutable, or the proxy can't reach it.

The `reply=N` codes follow RFC 1928 section 6, useful when grepping
provider docs.

## Source-IP binding combined with SOCKS5

`WithLocalAddress` works with SOCKS5 too. The local address binds the
socket from your machine to the SOCKS5 server. The proxy still picks
its own egress IP for the upstream side, you don't get to influence
that from the client. Use this when your machine has multiple public IPs
and you want to route the SOCKS5 control connection out a specific one.
