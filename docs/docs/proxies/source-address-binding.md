# Source Address Binding

Sometimes you need every outgoing socket to leave from a specific local
IP. Reasons:

- Your machine has multiple public IPs and you want to pick one.
- You have a routed IPv6 prefix (`/64` or wider) and want to rotate
  source IPs per request out of a huge pool.
- Audit / compliance requires a known egress IP.
- You're testing IPv6 behavior on a dual-stack box.

httpcloak gives you two options for this. They both set the same
internal field, pick whichever ergonomic fits your code.

## The options

`WithLocalAddress(string)` takes a string IP. Both v4 and v6 work:

```go
httpcloak.WithLocalAddress("192.168.1.100")
httpcloak.WithLocalAddress("2001:db8::dead:beef")
```

`WithLocalAddrIP(net.IP)` takes a parsed `net.IP`. Useful when you've
got an IP from a pool or a randomizer and you don't want to round-trip
through a string. Nil is a no-op so you can safely write
`opts = append(opts, httpcloak.WithLocalAddrIP(maybeNil))` without
clobbering a previously-set address.

```go
ip := pickRandomFromPool() // returns net.IP
httpcloak.WithLocalAddrIP(ip)
```

There's also `WithSessionPreferIPv4()` which is unrelated to local
binding but commonly comes up alongside it. It opts the dialer out of
Happy Eyeballs and forces v4 lookups. Use it on networks where IPv6 is
half-broken.

## What it does at the socket layer

Every outgoing socket (direct dial, dial-to-proxy, UDP for QUIC)
gets `LocalAddr` set to the chosen IP with port 0 (kernel picks the
ephemeral port). The kernel then tries to bind that source address
before the connect.

On Linux, httpcloak also calls `setsockopt(IP_FREEBIND)` and
`setsockopt(IPV6_FREEBIND)` on the raw socket before the bind. Why this
matters next.

## Linux `IP_FREEBIND`: bind addresses you don't "own"

By default a Linux box won't let you bind to an IP that isn't
configured on any of its interfaces. You'd get `EADDRNOTAVAIL`.
`IP_FREEBIND` (and the IPv6 equivalent) bypass that check. The kernel
trusts that you know what you're doing.

This is the magic that makes IPv6 prefix rotation cheap. Your hoster
routes a `/64` (or `/56`, or `/48`) to your box. You don't have to
configure 18 quintillion addresses on the interface. You just bind
to whichever address you want from the prefix and `IP_FREEBIND` lets
the bind succeed. Outgoing packets carry that source address, return
packets get routed back because the upstream router knows the prefix is
yours.

httpcloak applies `FREEBIND` unconditionally on Linux. Failures are
silently ignored. If the kernel rejects it, the bind would have worked
anyway because the address was locally configured, and we don't want
to fail the simple case.

:::tip IPv6 /64 rotation
If you have a `/64` (or wider) routed to your box and want a fresh
source IP per request, generate a random suffix and pass it to
`WithLocalAddrIP`. Linux freebind handles the rest, no `ip addr add`
required.

## Permissions on Linux

`IP_FREEBIND` works without root in two cases:

- Per-process: granted via `CAP_NET_ADMIN` (rare for userland).
- System-wide: `sysctl net.ipv4.ip_nonlocal_bind=1` and the IPv6
  equivalent `net.ipv6.ip_nonlocal_bind=1`.

Most production setups go with the sysctl. Add to `/etc/sysctl.d/`:

```
net.ipv4.ip_nonlocal_bind = 1
net.ipv6.ip_nonlocal_bind = 1
```

Without one of these, binding to a non-configured address still fails
even with `FREEBIND` set. The setsockopt is necessary but not
sufficient on stock kernels.

## Platform notes

- **Linux**: Full support. `IP_FREEBIND` + sysctl as above.
- **macOS / Darwin**: Bind works for addresses configured on an
  interface. Non-local bind isn't available the way Linux does it.
- **Windows**: Same as macOS.
- **Other Unix**: `freebind_other.go` is a no-op. The bind goes through
  but non-local addresses will fail at the kernel.

If you run on Linux and your code is portable, design for the Linux
behavior and accept the other platforms as best-effort.

## Examples

### Pin to a specific IPv4

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs groupId="lang">
<TabItem value="go" label="Go">

```go
s := httpcloak.NewSession("chrome-latest",
    httpcloak.WithLocalAddress("203.0.113.10"),
)
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="python" label="Python">

```python
s = httpcloak.Session(
    preset="chrome-latest",
    local_address="203.0.113.10",
)
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="node" label="Node.js">

```js
const s = new Session({
  preset: 'chrome-latest',
  localAddress: '203.0.113.10',
});
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="dotnet" label=".NET">

```csharp
using var s = new Session(
    preset: "chrome-latest",
    localAddress: "203.0.113.10");
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Bind to a specific IPv6

```go
import "net"

s := httpcloak.NewSession("chrome-latest",
    httpcloak.WithLocalAddrIP(net.ParseIP("2001:db8::1")),
)
```

### Rotating IPv6 from a /64

```go
import (
    "crypto/rand"
    "net"
)

func randomFromPrefix64(prefix net.IP) net.IP {
    suffix := make([]byte, 8)
    _, _ = rand.Read(suffix)
    out := make(net.IP, 16)
    copy(out[:8], prefix.To16()[:8])
    copy(out[8:], suffix)
    return out
}

prefix := net.ParseIP("2001:db8:abcd:1234::") // your routed /64
ip := randomFromPrefix64(prefix)

s := httpcloak.NewSession("chrome-latest",
    httpcloak.WithLocalAddrIP(ip),
)
defer s.Close()

resp, _ := s.Get(ctx, "https://httpbin.org/ip")
// returns the random v6 address you picked
```

You'd run that for each fresh request (a new session per IP, or pool
the sessions by IP). The session itself caches one local address for
its lifetime. The rotation happens at session-construction time.

### Combined with a proxy

Local binding and proxy options compose. The local address binds the
*client → proxy* socket; the proxy still picks its own egress for the
target connection.

```go
s := httpcloak.NewSession("chrome-latest",
    httpcloak.WithSessionTCPProxy("socks5://user:pass@proxy.example.com:1080"),
    httpcloak.WithLocalAddress("203.0.113.10"),
)
```

This makes sense when your machine has multiple egress IPs and you want
the SOCKS5 control connection to leave from a known one (routing,
firewall ACLs, etc).
