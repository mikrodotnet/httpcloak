# Speculative TLS

A standard HTTP CONNECT proxy dial costs two round-trips before any TLS bytes hit the wire:

1. Client opens TCP to the proxy.
2. Client writes `CONNECT target:443 HTTP/1.1` and waits.
3. Proxy writes `HTTP/1.1 200 Connection established` and waits.
4. Client writes the TLS ClientHello.
5. Proxy relays it. Server replies. Handshake continues.

Steps 2-3 burn one full RTT. Steps 4 onward are the actual TLS handshake. On a 50ms-RTT proxy, that's 50ms of dead air doing nothing useful, every time a fresh proxied dial goes out.

`WithEnableSpeculativeTLS` collapses that round-trip. The CONNECT request and the inner ClientHello get written to the socket in the same burst, before the proxy has a chance to reply with its 200. A well-behaved proxy reads the CONNECT, sets up the upstream tunnel, and immediately starts forwarding the bytes that came after the `\r\n\r\n`. The 200 still comes back, but the ClientHello overlaps with it instead of waiting for it. One round-trip saved.

:::tip
Free win for any proxy-heavy workload. If you're making lots of fresh proxied dials, flip this on.

## What it looks like on the wire

A non-speculative dial sends two distinct write bursts to the proxy:

```
burst 1: CONNECT httpbin.org:443 HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: httpbin.org:443\r\n\r\n
[wait for 200]
burst 2: \x16\x03\x01... (TLS ClientHello)
```

A speculative dial coalesces them:

```
burst 1: CONNECT httpbin.org:443 HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: httpbin.org:443\r\n\r\n\x16\x03\x01... (CONNECT + ClientHello in the same write)
[200 comes back overlapping with the upstream forwarding]
```

The lib still parses the proxy's 200 response correctly, the proxy still sees a valid CONNECT request. The only thing that changes is the timing on the wire.

## When it doesn't help

- **No proxy.** Speculative TLS is a CONNECT-path optimization. Direct dials don't have a CONNECT exchange to fold the ClientHello into, so the option is a no-op.
- **SOCKS5 proxies.** SOCKS has its own framing and the lib doesn't apply the speculative trick on the SOCKS path. Stick with HTTP CONNECT for this win.
- **Already-warm connections.** The savings only land on the first dial. Once the H2 or H1 connection is in the pool, requests reuse it and there's no proxy handshake left to optimize.

## When it can break

Some proxies are picky. They expect to read the CONNECT, write the 200, and only then start reading more bytes. If the client sends extra bytes before the 200 is fully written, the proxy might do one of three things:

- Buffer the speculative ClientHello correctly and forward it upstream once the tunnel's up. Common case.
- Reject the CONNECT outright with a parse error. Rare, but seen on older Squid setups and a handful of debugging tools.
- Drop the speculative bytes silently, leaving the inner TLS handshake stuck waiting for the server's reply. Worst case.

If a proxy looks like it's misbehaving, turn the option off and re-test. A fresh dial that works without speculative and hangs with it is the signal. Write the proxy brand down somewhere so future you remembers.

## Compatibility status by proxy class

- Modern commercial residential and datacenter proxies: works. Squid 4+, Tinyproxy, mitmproxy in upstream mode, Bright Data, Oxylabs, the usual suspects. Verified in production.
- Squid 3.x with old defaults: hit or miss. Test before you trust.
- Corporate egress proxies (BlueCoat, Zscaler, Forcepoint): mostly untested in this project. Some inspect the CONNECT carefully and may not tolerate extra bytes before the 200.
- TLS-terminating MITM proxies: doesn't matter. They terminate inside the proxy and re-originate, so the ClientHello sent by the client isn't the one that reaches the target anyway.

## Pairing with other features

Speculative TLS composes with the rest of the lib:

- Works with H1, H2, and H3-over-MASQUE alike (whenever the dial path is HTTP CONNECT, which for H3 means MASQUE specifically).
- Works with `WithECHFrom`. The ECH-wrapped ClientHello is what gets pipelined.
- Works with custom JA3 / JA4 fingerprints.
- Works with session resumption. The speculative ClientHello can carry a PSK and resume in one round-trip.

Stack speculative TLS, session resumption, and ECH on a proxy-heavy workload and the first request reaches data in one round-trip with the SNI encrypted on the way out. That's a Chrome-class profile very few clients ship with by default.
